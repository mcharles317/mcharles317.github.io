This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(waffle)
install.packages("hoopR")
# You can install using the pacman package using the following code:
if (!requireNamespace('pacman', quietly = TRUE)){
  install.packages('pacman')
}
library(dplyr)
```
```{r}
tictoc::tic()
progressr::with_progress({
  nba_team_box <- hoopR::load_nba_team_box(2016:2021)
})

tictoc::toc()
```

```{r}
NBA2022 <- nba_team_box %>% 
  filter(season == "2021") %>% 
  group_by (team_name) %>% 
summarize(avg_3pt = mean(three_point_field_goals_made_three_point_field_goals_attempted)/mean(three) *100)

  
```
```{r}
nba_team_box %>% 
  
```




Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

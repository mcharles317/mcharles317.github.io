In this column, I had to seperate columns in half in order to have two seperate data inputs. This will become more helpful later on. Also, this data came as characters not numbers, so I also adjusted that here. 
```{r}
nba_team_box_better <- nba_team_box %>%
  separate(three_point_field_goals_made_three_point_field_goals_attempted, c('three_point_makes', 'three_point_attempts'),"-") %>% 
  separate(free_throws_made_free_throws_attempted, c('free_throw_makes', 'free_throw_attempts'),"-") %>% 
  mutate(three_point_makes= as.numeric(three_point_makes), three_point_attempts= as.numeric(three_point_attempts ), total_rebounds= as.numeric(total_rebounds), total_turnovers =as.numeric(total_turnovers), points_in_paint= as.numeric(points_in_paint), assists= as.numeric(assists), free_throw_makes =as.numeric(free_throw_makes),free_throw_attempts= as.numeric(free_throw_attempts), field_goal_pct= as.numeric(field_goal_pct), three_point_field_goal_pct= as.numeric(three_point_field_goal_pct))
```
Here I filtered out teams that aren't actual NBA teams.
```{r}
nba_team_box_better <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
  filter(team_display_name!= "All-Stars", team_display_name!= "Team LeBron", team_display_name!= "World", team_display_name!= "USA", team_display_name!= "Team Stephen", team_display_name!= "Team Giannis", team_display_name!= "Team Durant")
```


I completed the following step for each corresponding year from 2016- 2021 in reverse chronological order. 
```{r}
NBA2022 <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2020-12-20', game_date <= '2021-05-19') %>% 
group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
summarize(avg_3pt = sum(three_point_makes)/sum(three_point_attempts)*100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_3pt))
```
```{r}
Totals2021 <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2020-12-20', game_date <= '2021-05-19') %>% 
group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
  summarise(three_point_attempts = sum(three_point_attempts), Assists = sum(assists), FG = mean(field_goal_pct), FTA = sum(free_throw_attempts), fg_3pt= mean(three_point_field_goal_pct)) 
```

Grouping key statistics that I focused on throughout the process. 
```{r}
Turnovers <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2020-12-20', game_date <= '2021-05-19') %>% 
  group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
  summarise(all_turnovers = sum(total_turnovers))
```
```{r}
PIP <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2020-12-20', game_date <= '2021-05-19') %>% 
  group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
  summarise(sum(points_in_paint))
```
```{r}
Assists <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2020-12-20', game_date <= '2021-05-19') %>% 
  group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
  summarise(sum(assists))
```
```{r}
ThreePointAttempts <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2020-12-20', game_date <= '2021-05-19') %>% 
  group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
  summarise(sum(three_point_attempts))
```

The stats within the select are the categories I used to group each team for clustering. This code helped me
determine how many clusters would work best. 
```{r}
TotalScale_2021 <- Totals2021 %>%
  select(three_point_attempts, Assists, FG,fg_3pt) %>%
  mutate_all(scale) %>%
  na.omit()
```
```{r}
 # function to compute total within-cluster sum of square
wss <- function(k) {
  kmeans(TotalScale_2021, k, nstart = 10 )$tot.withinss
}

# Compute and plot wss for k = 1 to k = 15
k.values <- 1:15

# extract wss for 2-15 clusters
wss_values <- map_dbl(k.values, wss)

plot(k.values, wss_values,
       type="b", pch = 19, frame = FALSE,
       xlab="Number of clusters K",
       ylab="Total within-clusters sum of squares")


```
```{r}
k6_2021 <- kmeans(TotalScale_2021, centers = 6, nstart = 10)

```
This is the dataframe to create the cluster chart.
```{r}
k6_2021
teamcluster_2021 <- data.frame(Totals2021, k6_2021$cluster)
champ2021 <- teamcluster_2021 %>% 
  filter(team_display_name == "Milwaukee Bucks")
```
Here, I am adding a wins column to add an extra layer of analysis.
```{r}
standings2021 <- espn_nba_standings(2021) %>% mutate(season = 2021)

teamcluster_2021 <- teamcluster_2021 %>% inner_join(standings2021, by=c("team_display_name"="team"))

```

This is used to isolate the Bucks (in this case) in order to plot them inidivually on the chart. It also allows me to compare the Bucks to other team's in their cluster. 
```{r}
Bucks <- teamcluster_2021 %>% filter(team_display_name == "Milwaukee Bucks")

cluster4<- teamcluster_2021 %>% filter(k6_2021.cluster == 4)


```
Now, I can graph specifically based on three point attempts and corresponding percentage, also factoring wins.
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=teamcluster_2021, aes(x=fg_3pt, y=three_point_attempts, size = wins, color=k6_2021.cluster))
geom_point(data=Bucks, aes(x=fg_3pt, y=three_point_attempts, color= "red",))
```
Based on the Bucks' cluster and their position in this graphic, it's clear to see why the Bucks were champions. Their cluster was also made up of the Nets, Nuggets, Clippers and Suns, all of whom made it to at least the conference semifinals. The Bucks beat the Nets and Suns in route to a championship.

This exact process was repeated for every season... Here are the results!
#2020 Season
```{r}
NBA2020 <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2019-10-21', game_date <= '2020-08-15') %>% 
group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
summarize(avg_3pt = sum(three_point_makes)/sum(three_point_attempts)*100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_3pt))
```
```{r}
Totals2020 <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2019-10-21', game_date <= '2020-08-15') %>% 
 group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
  summarise(ThreePointAttempts = sum(three_point_attempts), Assists = sum(assists), FG = mean(field_goal_pct), FTA = sum(free_throw_attempts), fg_3pt= mean(three_point_field_goal_pct)) 
```

```{r}
TotalScale2020 <- Totals2020 %>%
select(ThreePointAttempts, Assists, FG, fg_3pt) %>%
  mutate_all(scale) %>%
  na.omit()
```
```{r}
 # function to compute total within-cluster sum of square
wss <- function(k) {
  kmeans(TotalScale2020, k, nstart = 10 )$tot.withinss
}

# Compute and plot wss for k = 1 to k = 15
k.values <- 1:15

# extract wss for 2-15 clusters
wss_values <- map_dbl(k.values, wss)

plot(k.values, wss_values,
       type="b", pch = 19, frame = FALSE,
       xlab="Number of clusters K",
       ylab="Total within-clusters sum of squares")


```


When I attempt to make another cluster, it overwrites the previous one. How do I fix that?
```{r}
k6_2020 <- kmeans(TotalScale2020, centers = 6, nstart = 10)
```

```{r}
k6_2020
teamcluster_2020 <- data.frame(Totals2020, k6_2020$cluster)
```
```{r}
standings2020 <- espn_nba_standings(2020) %>% mutate(season = 2020)

teamcluster_2020 <- teamcluster_2020 %>% inner_join(standings2020, by=c("team_display_name"="team"))

```

```{r}
Lakers <- teamcluster_2020 %>% filter(team_display_name == "Los Angeles Lakers")
cluster5_2020<- teamcluster_2020 %>% filter(k6_2020.cluster == 5)
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=teamcluster_2020, aes(x=fg_3pt, y=ThreePointAttempts, size = wins, color=k6_2020.cluster)) +
  geom_point(data=Lakers, aes(x=fg_3pt, y=ThreePointAttempts, color="red")
```
Analyzing this chart and the corresponding clustering, the Lakers are acutally an outlier among the champions. However, they fall in the same cluster as the Denver Nuggets who they faced in the Western Conference Finals. 

#2019 season
```{r}
NBA2019 <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2018-10-16', game_date <= '2019-04-10') %>% 
  group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
summarize(avg_3pt = sum(three_point_makes)/sum(three_point_attempts)*100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_3pt))
```
```{r}
Totals2019 <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2018-10-16', game_date <= '2019-04-10') %>% 
  group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
  summarise(ThreePointAttempts = sum(three_point_attempts), Assists = sum(assists), FG = mean(field_goal_pct), FTA = sum(free_throw_attempts), fg_3pt= mean(three_point_field_goal_pct)) 
```


```{r}
NBA2019 <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2018-10-16', game_date <= '2019-04-10') %>% 
  group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
summarize(avg_3pt = sum(three_point_makes)/sum(three_point_attempts)*100) %>%

```
```{r}
Totals2019 <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2018-10-16', game_date <= '2019-04-10') %>% 
  group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
 group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
  summarise(ThreePointAttempts = sum(three_point_attempts), Assists = sum(assists), FG = mean(field_goal_pct), FTA = sum(free_throw_attempts), fg_3pt= mean(three_point_field_goal_pct)) 
```

```{r}
TotalScale2019 <- Totals2019 %>%
select(ThreePointAttempts, Assists, FG, fg_3pt) %>%
  mutate_all(scale) %>%
  na.omit()
```
```{r}
 # function to compute total within-cluster sum of square
wss <- function(k) {
  kmeans(TotalScale2019, k, nstart = 10 )$tot.withinss
}

# Compute and plot wss for k = 1 to k = 15
k.values <- 1:15

# extract wss for 2-15 clusters
wss_values <- map_dbl(k.values, wss)

plot(k.values, wss_values,
       type="b", pch = 19, frame = FALSE,
       xlab="Number of clusters K",
       ylab="Total within-clusters sum of squares")


```

```{r}
k6_2019 <- kmeans(TotalScale2019, centers = 6, nstart = 10)
```

```{r}
k6_2019
teamcluster_2019 <- data.frame(Totals2019, k6_2019$cluster)
```

```{r}
standings2019 <- espn_nba_standings(2019) %>% mutate(season = 2019)

teamcluster_2019 <- teamcluster_2019 %>% inner_join(standings2019, by=c("team_display_name"="team"))

```

```{r}
Raptors <- teamcluster_2019 %>% filter(team_display_name == "Toronto Raptors")
cluster4_2019<- teamcluster_2019 %>% filter(k6_2019.cluster == 4)
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=teamcluster_2019, aes(x=fg_3pt, y=ThreePointAttempts, size = wins, color=k6_2019.cluster)) +
  geom_point(data=Raptors, aes(x=fg_3pt, y=ThreePointAttempts), color="red")
```
Similar to the Bucks in 2021, the Raptors find themselves in elite company in their cluster. They are joined by the Bucks, Warriors and Celtics. Toronto defeated Milwaukee in the conference finals before beating the Warriors in six games. Milwaukee eliminated Boston in the first round. Again, this shows that the elite teams can be grouped together and projected by a few specific statistical categories. 


#2018
```{r}
NBA2018 <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2017-10-17', game_date <= '2018-04-11') %>% 
  group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
summarize(avg_3pt = sum(three_point_makes)/sum(three_point_attempts)*100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_3pt))
```
```{r}
Totals2018 <- nba_team_box_better %>% 
filter(game_date >= '2017-10-17', game_date <= '2018-04-11') %>% 
  group_by (team_display_name) %>% 
  summarise(ThreePointAttempts = sum(three_point_attempts), Assists = sum(assists), FG = mean(field_goal_pct), FTA = sum(free_throw_attempts), fg_3pt= mean(three_point_field_goal_pct))

```

```{r}
TotalScale2018 <- Totals2018 %>%
select(ThreePointAttempts, Assists, FG, fg_3pt) %>%
  mutate_all(scale) %>%
  na.omit()
```
```{r}
 # function to compute total within-cluster sum of square
wss <- function(k) {
  kmeans(TotalScale2018, k, nstart = 10 )$tot.withinss
}

# Compute and plot wss for k = 1 to k = 15
k.values <- 1:15

# extract wss for 2-15 clusters
wss_values <- map_dbl(k.values, wss)

plot(k.values, wss_values,
       type="b", pch = 19, frame = FALSE,
       xlab="Number of clusters K",
       ylab="Total within-clusters sum of squares")


```
```{r}
k6_2018 <- kmeans(TotalScale2018, centers = 6, nstart = 10)
```

```{r}
k6_2018
teamcluster_2018 <- data.frame(Totals2018, k6_2018$cluster)
```
```{r}
standings2018 <- espn_nba_standings(2018) %>% mutate(season = 2018)

teamcluster_2018 <- teamcluster_2018 %>% inner_join(standings2018, by=c("team_display_name"="team"))

```

```{r}
Warriors <- teamcluster_2018 %>% filter(team_display_name == "Golden State Warriors")
cluster5_2018 <- teamcluster_2018 %>% filter(k6_2018.cluster == 5)
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=teamcluster_2018, aes(x=fg_3pt, y=ThreePointAttempts, size = wins, color=k6_2018.cluster)) +
  geom_point(data=Warriors, aes(x=fg_3pt, y=ThreePointAttempts), color="red")
```
Based on the clustering and the chart, the Warriors were unquestionably the best shooting team in basketball. They marched to an easy title in 2018 and are thought to be one of the greatest team's in NBA history. Again, the data supports our hypothesis.

```


Conclusions:
Before figuring out cluster:
I chose these specific statistics because I feel that they are key indicators of potential success, especially over an 82 game season. While turnovers are not ideal, they are also a bi-product of high efficiency, quick moving offenses. Therefore, it would be interesting to further determine how this stat factors into crowning an NBA champion. Points in the paint and three point makes are specifically relevant because in the modern NBA, during the regular season, teams are looking for open three or open layups consistently. The best teams are able to live in these areas and therefore become strong indicators of winning. Assists again highlight the strength of a high powered offense, with worse teams tending to generate less assists. Rebounding works in a similar manner, giving insight into potentially the quality of a team's defense or their effectiveness cleaning up their own misses.

After figuring out cluster:
After narrowing down my main statistical determinants to three point makes, assists,field goal percentage and free throws attempted, the team that won the championship ended up in the strongest cluster every time besides 2016.I chose three point makes because some of the best offenses in basketball shoot the most threes therefore they are likely to make the most. Similarly with field goal percentage, efficiency is usually the mark of a good team. I chose free throw attempts because my thought is that the best players get to the line often. Therefore, a team with the best players are also likely to be the best teams. Finally, I chose assists because they signify easy offense which the best offenses tend to have. By clustering them together, I expected to find the best teams in the NBA in the most positive cluster, which came to fruition. 

From here, i am attempting to make cluster charts for each team. I specifically want to highlight a certain selection of teams on each chart if possible. I attempted code for that but it wasn't working out properly so I scraped it. I feel like highlighting these specific points will help depict my findings well. 


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
